# c++
kuliah pemrograman dasar

I'm using two of IDE
1. Visual Studio
2. Devc++

the between of it's any have a contradiction in function , using variable , etc . . .

# i like visual studio because system procedure call use a api key
# i like devc++ because program can be run in the litle of cerr ( error )
