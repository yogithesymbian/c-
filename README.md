# c++
kuliah pemrograman dasar

I'm using two of IDE
1. Visual Studio
2. Devc++

the between of it's any have a contradiction in function , using variable , etc . . .
i like visual studio because system procedure call use a api key , but 
i like devc++ because program can be run in the litle of cerr ( error )

-------------------

u must be know : Basic , object oriented and advance ..
if u want me , to make some program or ( i can say " Freelancer " ) ok , i accept it.
